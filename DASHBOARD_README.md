# 📊 LinkedIn Job Posts Dashboard

A simple Streamlit dashboard to visualize LinkedIn job posting data extracted from the job automation workflow.

## Features

- 📋 **Job Postings Table**: View all extracted job data in a clean, organized table
- 📈 **Summary Statistics**: See total jobs, active jobs, total amount spent, views, and apply clicks
- 🔍 **Detailed View**: Toggle to see full JSON data for individual jobs
- 🎯 **LinkedIn URL Column**: Clickable links to view the original LinkedIn job posting (displayed as "LinkedIn URL")
- 🎯 **Apply URL Column**: Clickable links to job applications (displayed as "Apply Url")

## Installation

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Run the dashboard:**
```bash
streamlit run job_posts_dashboard.py
```

2. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:8501`

## Data Source

The dashboard reads job data from JSON files in the `linked_job_posts/` directory. These files are generated by running:

```bash
python scripts/extract_multiple_jobs.py --job-ids-file inputs/job_ids_list.txt --output-dir linked_job_posts
```

**Smart Extraction**: The script automatically skips jobs that already exist in the output directory. Use `--force` to re-extract all jobs.

**Data Types**: The workflow extracts numeric values correctly - amount spent as float, views and apply clicks as integers.

```bash
# Normal run (skips existing jobs)
python scripts/extract_multiple_jobs.py --job-ids-file inputs/job_ids_list.txt

# Force re-extraction of all jobs
python scripts/extract_multiple_jobs.py --job-ids-file inputs/job_ids_list.txt --force
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No data showing**: Make sure you've run the job extraction workflow first
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Port issues**: Streamlit runs on port 8501 by default, make sure it's available
- **Jobs not extracting**: Check if jobs already exist (script skips existing by default). Use `--force` to re-extract all jobs
- **Empty results**: Verify job IDs are valid and accessible on LinkedIn
- **Data type issues**: Numeric values (amount spent, views, apply clicks) are now properly extracted as numbers, not strings
- **Total Amount Spent**: Shows the sum of all job promotion budgets (₹XXX.XX format)
